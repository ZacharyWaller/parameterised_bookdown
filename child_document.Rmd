## Child Document

This is unrelated to turning parameterised reports into books, but is a helpful 
feature anyway that I thought would be helpful to put in.

This is a child document that will only appear when certain parameters are passed 
to the parameterised document. Using child documents allows you to add extra content 
to parameterised documents so you can customise them a bit!

Here's some random code from the default rmarkdown file to show that code and 
figures still work when making a book of parameterised reports.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
