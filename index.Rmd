description: "This is a minimal example of turning a parameterised rmarkdown report into a book."

# Intro

This book uses a parameterised report and an `index.Rmd` to make a book.
The idea is to render the parameterised report into `.md` files, which will fill 
the parameters in and generate images, but keep the files in plan text format.

These reports then get pasted together (with the `index` file at the start) and 
rendered into one book.
