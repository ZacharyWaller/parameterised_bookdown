# Intro

This book uses a parameterised report and an `index.Rmd` to make a book.
The idea is to render the parameterised report into `.md` files, which will fill 
the parameters in and generate images, but keep the files in plan text format.

These reports then get pasted together (with the `index` file at the start) and 
rendered into one book. This approach is a little hacky (I largely just took 
snippets of code from the bookdown source) and doesn't do much fancy stuff (it 
doesn't quite put files in the right place), but hopefully it'll be helpful to 
someone!
